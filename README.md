# School project to generate extreme values from GAN

Comparison of conventional GAN, ExGAN, EvtGAN and EV-GAN.

In data the original dataset can be found alongside, the noise used as input for the ExGAN model and the generated data obtained.

In model the ExGAN trained model can be found alongside the scaler used for the original data.
